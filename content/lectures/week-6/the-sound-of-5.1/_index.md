## The Sound Of 5.1

## Aural Aesthetics

---

> The design, technical considerations, and specifications that went into the digital sound track are to provide a medium that theoretically has no limitation. The digital medium is not the restrictive part of the process anymore.

1990s - 5.1 digital surround first appeared and gave filmmakers

- better dynamic range,
- more channels
- more flexibility for spatialization of sounds

But, movies could not take full advantage of these capabilities yet.

- Few theaters had DSS systems
- Filmmakers had to make sure their soundtracks sounded good mixed with Dolby Stereo

### Today's Landscape

- 5.1 is a standard
- Many theaters also using Dolby Surround 7.1
- [6900+ Dolby Atmos theatres](https://professional.dolby.com/cinema/) across 100+ countries

{{% note %}}
Because of the standardization of surround in movie theatres and home setups, filmmakers became less concerned with how their work will sound with Dolby Stereo.

### Movies got louder

- DSS has a larger dynamic range than previous formats
- Factors for dynamic range
  - Amount of space available for audio data
  - Analogue - 35mm filmstrip (Dolby SR) - 78 dB
  - Digital surround formats (Dolby Digital, SDSS, DTS) - over 100 dB

{{% note %}}

- Dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and softest sounds a system can reproduce.
- It is measured in decibels (dB) and can be found by adding a format’s headroom (how much louder than a designated reference level a signal can be before it distorts or clips) to its signal-to- noise ratio (the distance between that reference level and the inherent noise of the system).
- Dolby SR film soundtracks only achieve a dynamic range of about 78 dB—far less than Dolby SR encoding offers in other formats with more space for the soundtrack.
- Digital surround’s wide dynamic range means that within any given movie, it can include both very loud sounds and very soft ones, in theory surpassing the capabilities of Dolby Stereo and Dolby SR on both ends.

In simpler terms:

- Dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and quietest sound a system can produce.
- Dolby SR film soundtracks have a dynamic range of about 78 dB, which is less than other formats.
- Digital surround sound has a wider dynamic range, which means it can produce both very loud and very quiet sounds.

### Movies headroom

- Headroom - how much louder than its “average” volume level a soundtrack’s loudest parts can be.
- 1960s - monophonic sound - 6 dB headroom
- Dolby SR - 6 - 12 dB headroom (depending of frequency of sound)
- DSS - 20 dB headroom across entire frequency spectrum

{{% note %}}

- In the late sixties, monophonic sound had headroom of about 6 dB, meaning “the loudest sounds in the film could be six decibels over the level of average dialogue.”
- Since a 10 dB difference represents a doubling of perceived loudness, these numbers mean that relative to the “average” volume level of a soundtrack—for instance, the level of most dialogue—a digital soundtrack can make loud sounds that are more than twice as loud as the loudest sounds possible with Dolby SR.

In simpler terms:

- Digital soundtracks can produce sounds that are more than twice as loud as the loudest sounds possible with Dolby SR.
- This is because digital soundtracks have more headroom, which is the amount of loudness that is available above the average volume level of a soundtrack.

> When the digital format came out. . . . there were, in my opinion, a series of not very good and just painful mixes. Directors thought it was good: “My movie is going to be the best movie ever” . . . it was the big action pictures, they used to have to be loud.

In a properly calibrated theatrical setup, DSS soundtracks can get loud enough to approach the human threshold of pain.

> You may think it’s great and exciting and normal, but it’s not. . . . about 90 percent of America just doesn’t want to listen to stuff that loud at any time.

The problem with this approach, of course, was that while sitting in mixing studios for hours and days on end accustomed filmmakers to these extremely high volume levels, what they saw as normal was well beyond what most audiences considered comfortable

Audiences began to complain so mixes came down in level somewhat.

> A lot of movies are just loud all the time. . . . Underworld was probably the loudest movie I’ve seen in a long time. Every single kick, punch, whatever it was—everything had to be as loud as possible. Whereas a movie like that could have been a lot more effective had it been quieter in scenes instead of just loud all the time.

Still, overly loud mixes remain a concern among film sound professionals, many of whom find that only the high end of DSS’s dynamic range is being used:

DSS allows sounds in film to be much quieter as well as louder.

> The well-known fact that nearly all theaters play films at a lower level than they were mixed ironically causes many directors to insist that their films be mixed even louder in a desperate effort to compensate for the anticipated reduction, which of course causes the theaters to turn the sound down even more, etc., etc. ad infinitum.

- Movie theaters play movies at lower volumes than official standards to prevent sound from bleeding into neighboring theaters.
- This is especially important in multiplex theaters with many screens packed close together and little soundproofing.
- Trailers are mixed much louder than features to get your attention.

**Additional thoughts:**

- It is important to note that there are no official standards for movie theater volume. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that people not be exposed to noise levels above 85 dB for more than 8 hours per day. However, many movie theaters have sound levels that exceed this recommendation.
- If you find that the volume at a movie theater is too loud, you can ask the staff to turn it down. You can also bring earplugs or earmuffs to protect your hearing.

## Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)

**Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)**

- The opening sequence uses ambience to create a sense of dread and foreboding.
- The sound of wind is used to represent the devastation caused by a nuclear war.
- The juxtaposition of a young girl's laughter and the nuclear explosion is particularly effective in creating a sense of loss and despair.
- The sound of sand and dust playing across various surfaces, metal, and bone is used to create a sense of decay and ruin.
- Sarah Connor's voice-over invocation of the religious prophecy of "Judgment Day" reinforces the sense of Armageddon.

**Vivian Sobchack's observation about wind in science fiction:**

- Wind is often used in science fiction to represent change and upheaval. It can also be used to create a sense of mystery and wonder.

I would also add that the sound of wind in the opening sequence of Terminator 2 can be interpreted as a warning. It is a reminder that the future is not set in stone, and that our actions have consequences.

## Contact (1997)

{{% note %}}
**The opening sequence of Contact (1997):**

- The sequence begins with a tracking shot that starts at the Earth and moves out until it encompasses the entire galaxy.
- The scene begins with sound, but ends in the total silence of empty space.
- Director Robert Zemeckis refuses to temper the scene with any aural object, such as the quiet speaker hiss of a Dolby Stereo "silence."
- Instead, he uses the total silence made available by DSS to emphasize the feeling of emptiness this scene engenders.

**Additional thoughts:**

The use of silence in the opening of Contact is very effective. It creates a sense of awe and wonder, but also a sense of loneliness and isolation. It is a reminder that we are just a small part of a vast and mysterious universe.

## Frost/Nixon (2008)

{{% note %}}

**In the climax of Frost/Nixon:**

- The soundtrack is busy with the sounds of the television crew, the room tone, and Foley.
- But when Nixon finally admits wrongdoing, everything but his voice drops out of the soundtrack.
- This creates a sense of focus and emphasis on Nixon's words, and it allows the audience to fully experience the emotional impact of his admission.

## Superman Returns (2006)

{{% note %}}
**Superman Returns (2006)**

- The scene where a surgeon is picking shards of kryptonite from Superman's body uses silence in a similar way to Frost/Nixon.
- All sounds other than the clank of the shards dropping onto a table disappear.
- This creates a sense of focus and emphasis on the sound of the shards, and it allows the audience to fully experience the discomfort and danger of the situation.

**In both cases:**

- The emphasized sounds (Nixon's voice and the clinks of shards hitting metal) are actually fairly loud.
- However, the soundtrack seems silent due to its relative emptiness.

This is a very effective use of silence, and it is one of the ways that digital surround sound can be used to create a more immersive and impactful cinematic experience.

**Additional thoughts:**

The use of silence in both Frost/Nixon and Superman Returns is a reminder of the power of sound design. By carefully controlling what sounds the audience hears and when, filmmakers can create a wide range of emotional and psychological effects. In these two cases, silence is used to create a sense of focus, emphasis, and suspense.

It is also worth noting that the use of silence in these two scenes is not just a technical feat. It is also a creative choice that is made by the filmmakers in order to achieve a specific effect. This is just one example of how digital surround sound can be used to enhance the storytelling process.

### Backdraft (1991)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLUhwGLJhsI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Even before Dolby Digital, filmmakers would often use silence to make explosions seem louder.
- For example, Gary Rydstrom would use a moment of silence or expectation, followed by a sucking in of air, a light high sound, and then a rest, before the explosion.
- Digital surround sound (DSS) makes this process even more intense, by having quieter quiets and louder loud parts.
- Examples of filmmakers pairing true silences with loud transient sounds like explosions to exploit DSS's full dynamic range can be found in a wide variety of films.

**Additional thoughts:**

The use of silence to make explosions seem louder is a classic example of sound design. It is a simple but effective technique that can be used to create a more immersive and impactful cinematic experience.

DSS takes this technique to the next level by allowing for quieter quiets and louder loud parts. This means that the silence before an explosion can be even more complete, and the explosion itself can be even louder and more powerful.

This technique is often used in action films, but it can also be used in other genres, such as horror and science fiction. For example, in the horror film "The Quiet Place" (2018), the filmmakers use silence to create a sense of suspense and dread. When the monsters finally appear, they are all the more terrifying because of the silence that precedes them.

- Obi-Wan Kenobi is chasing Jango Fett through an asteroid field.
- To distract his pursuer, Fett launches a series of bombs.
- The explosions are loud on their own, but Lucas makes them sound even louder by dropping out all other sounds from the soundtrack about a half second before each one.

> You could listen to a symphony played at full blast with all the instruments at the same level for about ten minutes, and then it would begin to pall on you. What the musicians of the nineteenth century began to discover . . . was the idea of dynamics within each movement, of shrink- ing the orchestration down to a single instrument and then expanding it outward again at the right moment. It’s an approach that generally characterizes nineteenth-century music and is well suited to film.
