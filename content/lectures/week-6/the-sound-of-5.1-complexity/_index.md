## Discrete Channels And Complexity

> Why is 5.1 a notable improvement over Dolby Stereo?

{{% note %}}
- Digital sound is often associated with improved dynamic range, but it's more commonly recognized for its multi-channel capabilities, such as the "5.1" system that has become part of everyday language [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Dolby Stereo includes four channels: left, center, and right front plus mono surround. Digital surround systems use a similar setup but split the mono surround channel into stereo [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Digital surround sound offers completely discrete audio channels, meaning the content in each of its six channels is completely independent of what is in the others [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Dynamic range in music production is the decibel (dB) difference between the quietest and loudest sounds in a mix or audio file. The dynamic range can also refer to the loudest and quietest sounds hardware or audio systems can properly represent[1].
- The maximum dynamic range for human hearing is about 120 dB between the softest signal we can detect and when distortion starts to create physical pain. The theoretical dynamic range of undithered 20-bit quantization of digital audio is 120 dB[1].
- 5.1 surround sound is the most commonly used layout in home theatres. It uses five full bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel. All 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a Front Left (FL) and Front Right (FR), a Center Channel (CNT), two surround channels (Surround Left - SL and Surround Right - SR) and the low-frequency effects (SW) channel designed for a subwoofer[3].
- The dynamic range of a 16-bit / 44.1 kHz CD is over 90 dB — slightly greater than the range of human hearing. 24-bit digital audio has a theoretical dynamic range of 144 dB, but no playback system can equal that[4].
- Surround sound is a technique for enriching the fidelity and depth of sound reproduction by using multiple audio channels from speakers that surround the listener. The technique enhances the perception of sound spatialization by exploiting sound localization: a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance[6].

> If you get too many elements piled on top of one another, it becomes less dynamic. So sometimes I have a tendency to move stuff into the surrounds and have more all at once.

Digital sound, on the other hand, provided five separate channels across which sounds could spread. Filmmakers eagerly took advantage of this option,

## Masking

> When collapsed to one speaker or headphones, one sound of greater amplitude can cover another sound, creating a condition known as masking. . . . Variations of sound location, density, and volume in the surround channels can punctuate events on screen without the loss of intelligibility that might occur if the entire sound track was limited to the center speakers.

{{% note %}}
So since we are avoiding masking, we can put more _separately perceptible_ sounds in a soundtrack at a time.

## Complexity

> the general level of complexity . . . has been steadily increasing over the eight decades since film sound was invented. . . . Seventy years ago, for instance, it would not be unusual for an entire film to need only fifteen to twenty sound effects. Today that number could be hundreds to thou- sands of times greater.

## Audiences ability to perceive sound

- Humans can only pay attention to a limited amount of sounds at once
- re-recording mixers know this and hence shape their soundtracks to focus audience attention on only two (or at most three) perceived aural objects at a time.
- More sounds can be used if they are dissimilar

{{% note %}}
Overloading an audience can be used by a sound designer to create a particular emotion of a chaotic scene or something out of control. This should be used sparingly as to not overwhelm the audience to annoyance.

## Terminator 2

Show extended freeway chase scene

{{% note %}}
Its biggest action sequence, an extended freeway chase, moves a huge number of sounds around the multi-channel soundscape. Whether or not the audience actually notices all the individual sounds is irrelevant—in either case the feeling created is one of intense movement, speed, and action.

## Kinsey (2004)

- Driving across the country interviewing people for a study

{{% note %}}
Details: The montage sequence in the 2004 film "Kinsey" is described as follows:

- The sequence involves the title character, Kinsey, traveling across the country to conduct interviews for his sex study [INITIAL_QUERY].
- As Kinsey crisscrosses the U.S., the faces of his interviewees appear onscreen over a map of the country [INITIAL_QUERY].
- The voices of the interviewees begin to mingle together and spread throughout the theater, recounting their stories [INITIAL_QUERY].
- By the end of the montage, all five main sound channels are playing different sets of voices [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Despite the multitude of voices, each one remains individually discernible. Audience members have the option to focus on a particular voice to hear its story, or they can listen to the mix as a whole, which continuously shifts focus among different voices [INITIAL_QUERY].
- The result is a feeling of being overwhelmed by the number of different points of view present. This emotion is amplified by the clear sense that this is not just background noise, but a vast collection of individual voices, each with something worth saying [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Any sound, anywhere

{{% note %}}
Digital surround sound’s discrete channel system is not, of course, used only to increase soundtrack complexity. It also allows filmmakers to place each element of the soundtrack precisely in any of the five channels around the theater.

## Gladiator (2000)

Maximus walks from a small enclosed space out into the arena

{{% note %}}
Details: The scene from the 2000 film "Gladiator" featuring Maximus, played by Russell Crowe, is described as follows:

- The scene begins in a small enclosed space, the "waiting area" where Maximus is preparing for battle. Muffled sounds from outside can be heard in the background [INITIAL_QUERY].
- As Maximus moves out into the arena, the camera follows him and the soundtrack begins to shift. The sounds of the arena, now without the "muffling" effect, are gradually introduced to the front center, then the entire front, and eventually the entire theater as the sounds of the original waiting area fade out in the rear channels [INITIAL_QUERY].
- This sound design effectively conveys the overwhelming sensation of moving from a tiny underground tunnel to a gigantic stadium filled with cheering spectators. The use of all the main channels together precisely shapes the transition between these two spaces, enhancing the overall effect [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Contact

Rewatch opening scene in 5.1

{{% note %}}
Details: The opening scene of the film is described as follows:

- The film begins with a view of Earth, and the camera starts to move backward, tracking away from our planet through the outer reaches of the solar system and into deep space [INITIAL_QUERY].
- As the camera pulls back, the soundtrack conveys the travel of Earth's radio and television signals into space. This is done by moving recognizable music and news clips from the back of the theater to the front [INITIAL_QUERY].
- As the camera moves away from Earth, the sounds of history whiz by the audience. This creates an effect of traveling backward both spatially and temporally [INITIAL_QUERY].
- A similar sound effect, that of moving back into history, could potentially be created in a monophonic or Dolby Stereo environment. However, it would not have the same psychological and narrative power as actually hearing history fly by [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

places sounds all throughout the soundscape but carefully avoids putting effects in the surrounds that would draw attention away from the screen

{{% note %}}
For a lot of the background sounds and the walking on deck and such from a below-deck perspective, it worked very well to be all around us in the surrounds and in the front . . . there is nothing percussive only in the back that would draw you away from the front. It all worked together. . . . if you are looking at a ship scene from a deck perspective and you suddenly hear a rope crinkle, or some specific mast crack, or something behind you, it is distracting to the point where you are pulling people away from the story -- Paul Massey

## Avoiding the exit door effect - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)

Trailer - view on Apple TV Plus

{{% note %}}
The trailer for 2003’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake employs this strategy with great success. While the screen remains blank, a man’s heavy footsteps methodically pursue a woman—represented by her screams and running footsteps—around the multi-channel space of the theater, beginning in the back right channel and continuing around the front of the theater to the chase’s end in the front left channel. After the chainsaw roars into action, a simple title card reveals the name of the movie. In a mono environment, this trailer would be simply a lot of footsteps, a couple screams, and a saw powering up; in the multi-channel realm it becomes a clear and engrossing chase with no visuals required.

## Lifted (2006)

Play on Apple TV

{{% note %}}
Details: The 2006 short film "Lifted" uses the multi-channel soundscape to indicate actions happening offscreen. Here's a summary of the film's sound design:

- The film features an abductor-in-training who reacts to the offscreen sounds of an examiner making notes about his poor performance [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Throughout the film, sound effects are carefully panned to suggest offscreen chaos and other diegetic sounds outside the frame, such as the trainee's whining during a shot of his teacher making notes [INITIAL_QUERY].
- One of the film's funniest moments relies on a surround effect: the abductor-in-training finally succeeds in directing the human out of the bedroom window, only for a crash in the right surround channel to reveal that the body has hit a tree. This sound effect cues a cut to a wider shot revealing the body wedged in the tree's branches [INITIAL_QUERY].
- In this and other situations, the film's sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, carefully places sounds around the theater to heighten the film's drama and/or comedy. However, since all these sound effects have clearly indicated sources within the diegesis (even if those sources are not onscreen at the moment), the sound design never becomes distracting or "too big" for the story [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Panning and Dialogue

- The Kinsey example is a good one
- Also the T1000 melting at the end of Terminator 2

{{% note %}}
- Digital surround sound's use of discrete channels has started to change mixing practices, including for dialogue. Dialogue has traditionally been kept front and center, but can now be placed elsewhere with digital surround [INITIAL_QUERY].
- The Kinsey montage spreads interviewees' voices around the soundscape, not matching them spatially to the onscreen faces. Some voices are never associated with onscreen elements at all [INITIAL_QUERY].
- In Terminator 2, the T-1000's screams whip around the surround channels even as he remains onscreen. This violates conventions of matching image and sound, but fits the spectacle of the scene [INITIAL_QUERY]. 
- Spreading dialogue to surround channels goes against long-standing conventions. But filmmakers are starting to do this in certain stylized scenes where realism is not the priority [INITIAL_QUERY].
- Overall, digital surround's discrete channels have made it technically possible to spread dialogue around the theater. Some filmmakers are utilizing this capability, breaking from traditional conventions of keeping dialogue front and center [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Transitory Panning - Ratatouille (2007)

- At the end of a scene in Gusteau’s restaurant

{{% note %}}
Transitory panning is another way for filmmakers to “bend” the rule that dialogue belongs in the front center channel without breaking it—in these cases voices are briefly placed offscreen but “rehabilitated” once they have served their purpose. As one sound editor explains, panned dialogue is often most palatable when it is used only briefly, such as when someone yells something from offscreen before the camera cuts to show that person.71 An example of this type of transitory dialogue panning is a sound transition between two scenes in Ratatouille (2007). At the end of a scene in Gusteau’s restaurant, the soundtrack introduces the beginning of a speech by Django (father of the film’s rat hero Remy). Django (voiced by Brian Dennehy) is speaking in the rat’s nest where Remy’s family lives, but his line begins a few seconds before the image track cuts away from the restaurant. Overlapping image and sound from different scenes is a common transitional device used to smooth over the edit between two locales; what is unusual here is that during the time the dialogue of one space overlaps with the image of the other, Ratatouille mixes Django’s voice to all five main channels. The rationale for this mixing strategy seems to be to keep the audience from assuming a particular spatial relationship between the two places and is therefore short lived—once the camera cuts to the rat’s nest and Django appears onscreen, it is no longer necessary, and the dialogue quickly collapses back to the front center.

## Natural soundscape - Strange Days (1995)

{{% note %}}
Strange Days (1995), for example, pans voices all around the audience to simulate the experience of real life, where dialogue can come from all sides. Rydstrom, the film’s sound designer, acknowledges that this was an unusual tactic to take, but points out that “It’s dangerous to have rules” and asserts that accurately spatializing the dialogue was the right decision for a story partly about a technology that captures real experiences.

## Unnatural soundscape - The Ring (2003)

{{% note %}}
Can't find clip

here Strange Days employs panned voices to create a better match between soundtrack and diegetic world, the same device can be used to prohibit a match from being made between the two. Gore Verbinski’s The Ring (2003) at one point mixes a child’s voice into all five channels simultaneously so that it cannot be associated with a single location. In this scene, the lead character is recalling something her son had said to her, and it is his voice that plays all around the auditorium.

## Full Frequency Channels

{{% note %}}
Details: The development of specifications for digital motion picture soundtracks by SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) and its implications are summarized as follows:

- SMPTE recognized that the advantages of discrete channels in digital soundtracks would be partially lost if frequency limitations meant that the surround channels could only handle certain types of sounds. Therefore, it stipulated that every main channel should be able to reproduce all audible frequencies [INITIAL_QUERY].
- The combination of full-range channels with a discrete channel configuration means that any sound can be placed in any channel, and sounds can smoothly be panned from one channel to another [INITIAL_QUERY].
- While brief stereo "fly-bys" across the front speakers have long been a staple of multi-channel soundtracks, digital surround sound represents the first commonplace system where sounds can move not just across the screen but all throughout the theater [INITIAL_QUERY].
- The film "Apocalypse Now" famously panned helicopter sounds throughout the auditorium. However, the full splendor of this multi-channel mix was only heard by viewers in a few showcase houses, as the standard 35mm Dolby Stereo prints of "Apocalypse Now" did not even include a surround channel [INITIAL_QUERY].

## Low-Frequency Effects

- Phantom Menace Pod racer scene
- In _Lifted_: LFE used for UFO rumble

{{% note %}}
One channel in the 5.1 digital surround configuration does not have full-range capabilities: the “.1” low-frequency effects (LFE) channel.

The podrace sequence in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) demonstrates digital surround sound’s unique technical capabilities: the LFE channel makes the podracers seem “powerful,” and the discrete, full-range channel configuration enables the sounds of the racers to smoothly move around the auditorium to match the visuals.
