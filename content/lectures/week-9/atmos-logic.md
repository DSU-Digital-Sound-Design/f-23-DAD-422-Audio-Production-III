title: "Dolby Atmos with Logic X"
---

## Implementation

While Protools uses the standalone atmos renderer that we saw last week Logic uses a built in render. This is more convenient, but has drawbacks for the more professional user.

# Channel Routing

## Mono Components vs. Stereo Components

## Output Routing

These menus are dynamic and change depending on what audio interface you're connected to.

## Surround Formats

Changing the format here will change what each plugin can do. See the surround panner when changing surround formats, the speaker count changes.

## I/O Assignments (Output/Speakers)

## Master Channel Strip

Changing one track to surround mode updates your master channel strip.

In music mixing with Dolby Atmos, bed tracks and object tracks play essential roles in creating a three-dimensional and immersive audio experience for the listener. Here's how they are used in music production:

## **Bed Tracks in Music Mixing:**

1. **Foundation and Atmosphere:** Bed tracks in music mixing serve as the foundation of the audio mix, much like in other audio productions. They provide the continuous background ambiance and atmosphere for the music. This can include elements like the main instrumentals, background vocals, and any ambient sounds that contribute to the mood and sonic environment of the song.

2. **Stability and Consistency:** Bed tracks help maintain stability and consistency in the audio mix. They provide a stable backdrop for the music, ensuring that the listener has a sense of space and context throughout the song.

3. **Enhanced Spatialization:** While bed tracks are often more static than object tracks, they can still benefit from spatialization in Dolby Atmos. This means that even within the bed, individual elements can be positioned in three-dimensional space to create a more immersive listening experience. For example, you can position the lead vocals in front of the listener and the background vocals in the rear, creating a spatial separation that enhances the depth of the mix.

**Object Tracks in Music Mixing:**

1. **Dynamic Instrument Placement:** Object tracks in music mixing are particularly useful for dynamic instrument placement. Musicians and producers can use object tracks to position specific instruments or vocals in precise locations within the 3D sound space. This dynamic positioning can create a unique and immersive musical experience.

2. **Movement and Effects:** Object tracks can also be employed for creating movement and effects within the music. For example, you can make a guitar solo move around the listener, or you can use spatial effects like panning, auto-panning, and audio movement to add depth and excitement to the mix.

3. **Enhanced Creativity:** Object tracks offer musicians and producers a new level of creativity in mixing. They can experiment with spatialization to emphasize certain musical elements, create unique soundscapes, or even tell a spatial audio story within the music itself.

4. **Interaction with the Listener:** By using object tracks effectively, musicians can interact with the listener in novel ways. For instance, a musical element could start in one position and gradually move to another, drawing the listener's attention and enhancing the emotional impact of the music.
