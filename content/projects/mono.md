title: "Project 1: Mono"
---

Pick a silent film from the [Archive.org silent film archive](https://archive.org/details/silenthalloffame). Create a sound design for any 30-second clip in the movie you choose. Add enough sound effects to create a feeling of realism. You are limited to **mono playback**, so imagine simulating a space with only one channel. You could accomplish this using reverb, delay, filtering, or loudness.

Submit a rendered video file to D2L and a paragraph explaining your spatialization process using the project's limitations.

See [SoundQ](https://www.prosoundeffects.com/soundq/) for a great way to search through freesound.org and other sound effects libraries.
