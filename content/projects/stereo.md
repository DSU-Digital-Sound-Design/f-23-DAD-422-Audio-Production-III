title: "Project 2: Binaural/Stereo"
---

<!-- TODO: finish describing this -->

Create a piece of binaural music, sound design, or narrative fiction that uses binaural and stereo recording techniques. The piece should be one minute long. It can accompany a visual or stand alone. One of the recordings should use a stereo recording technique we learned in class. Another recording will use the Zoom H3-VR device in binaural mode. Include at least two panning automation moves. This could be to create a “fly-by” effect or another dynamic panning effect. All other sounds can be mono sources, but make sure to put some thought into how they are spatialized.

Use [Anaglyph](http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr/index.html) for the Binaural spatialization.
