    - [Double Midside Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0og6zGwXFY)
      - Routing: FL = side + mid, FR = phase inverted side + mid, C = mid, SL = side + rear, SR = phase inverted side + rear; map to correct channels with JS: Channel Mapper-Downmixer
      - Do the routing, then try to encode to ambisonics with the 5 channel encoder.

- _Ocean Eyes_ tips
  - A/B between your mix and the stereo mix to hear if you're loosing an important part.
- Setting up a mix from scratch
  - Mix Major Lazer

  - Bed tracks are 7.1.2, object tracks are 7.1.4, this is why object tracks are much more precise for spatial location. We can see this with a meter before and after the renderer.
  - Let's try to use some height modes, using automation, or sphere mode
